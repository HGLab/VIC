##This is an example of a user-specified evidence file, and can be used with "-s" option
#CBP0 is a measure of clinical and/or experimental evidence and can be 0;1;2(no clinical evidence;potential clinical significance;strong clinical significance)
#CBP1 is a measure of mutation types and can be 1;0 (activating, LOF (missense, nonsense, indel, splicing), CNVs, fusions;Functionally benign or unknown, mostly missense,in-frame indels, less commonly, othertypes)
#CBP2 is a measure of variant allele fraction and can be 1;0;-1 (mosaic;nonmosaic;unsure)
#CBP3 is a measure of potential germline and can be 1;0;-1 (nonmosaic;mosaic;unsure)
#CBP4 is a measure of population allele frequency and can be 1;0 (low MAF; high MAF)
#CBP5 is a measure of germline database and can be 2;1;0 (only pathogenic evidence;benign or likely benign;uncertain or contradictory)
#CBP6 is a measure of somatic database and can be 2;1;0 (pathogenic;likely pathogenic;uncertain)
#CBP7 is a measure of predictive software programs and can be 2;1;0 (pathogenic;uncertain or contradictory;benign or likely benign)
#CBP8 is a measure of pathway involvement and can be 2;1;0 (cancer-associated;potential association;unclear function)
#CBP9 is a measure of publications and can be 1;0;-1 (reported in any publications;no evidence;unsure)

#Evidence file should be tab-delimited and formated like this:
